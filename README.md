# Linux Device Driver Lab

This repository contains my structured experiments in Linux kernel device drivers, hardware-software interfacing, and performance benchmarking.

## Goals
- Develop character and platform device drivers
- Implement interrupt-driven I/O
- Study kernel synchronization mechanisms
- Benchmark latency and throughput
- Understand kernel ↔ user space communication

## Target Hardware
- Raspberry Pi 3/4
- Arduino (as peripheral device)

## Contents
- `src/kernel`   : Linux kernel modules & drivers
- `src/userspace`: User-space test applications
- `tests`        : Functional & stress tests
- `benchmarks`  : Performance measurement tools
- `docs`         : Architecture, concurrency & design notes

## Status
🚧 Initial setup complete. First GPIO driver coming next.
